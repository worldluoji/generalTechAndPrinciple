# 401和403的区别
401 - Unauthorized Indicates that authentication is required and was either not provided or has failed. 
If the request already included authorization credentials, 
then the 401 status code indicates that those credentials were not accepted.

收到401响应，表示请求没有被认证—压根没有认证或者认证不正确—但是请重新认证和重试。（一般在响应头部包含一个WWW-Authenticate来描述如何认证）。

403 - Forbidden Indicates that though the request was valid, the server refuses to respond to it. 
Unlike the 401 status code, providing authentication will not change the outcome.

收到403响应表示服务器完成认证过程，但是客户端请求没有权限去访问要求的资源。
